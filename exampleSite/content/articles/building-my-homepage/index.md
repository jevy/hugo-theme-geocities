If you're reading this, you probably noticed how **totally awesome** my homepage looks. Let me tell you how I did it!

## Getting Started

First, I installed [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and then added the Geocities theme. It was super easy:

```bash
hugo new site my-rad-site
cd my-rad-site
git submodule add https://github.com/jevy/hugo-theme-geocities themes/geocities
```

## Configuration

The theme has tons of configurable options. Check out the `config.toml` in the `exampleSite` folder for all the details.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add even more content to my site. Stay tuned for:

- A page about my pet hamster
- My top 10 favorite MIDI files
- A comprehensive list of the best animated GIFs
